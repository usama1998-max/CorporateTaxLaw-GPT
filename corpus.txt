You are a small business, does UAE Corporate Tax still apply?
Yes. The MoF has announced a small business tax relief scheme available to small businesses. Qualifying businesses as having no taxable income and being asked to undertake simplified compliance obligations.
The threshold is based on the revenue and not the profits/taxable income and is expected to be confirmed in a subsequent Cabinet Decision
Small businesses with a total revenue of below A ED3 million for each tax period will not be required to pay corporate tax. This is called the Small Business Relief scheme, which is available until the end of 2026. To claim small business relief, an election must be made to the FTA. However, any person who qualifies and avails the Small Business Relief under this Article remains a Taxable Person for the purposes of the Corporate Tax Law, and as such, will be required to meet the compliance obligations provided for in the Corporate Tax Law for each Tax Period.

Can you include all expenses to determine your UAE Corporate Tax liability.
No. Only expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes, (and which are not to be capitalized) are deductible. Certain types of expenses are subject to limits and cannot be fully expensed.

All businesses or individuals conducting commercial activities are subject to Corporate Tax Legislation.
Corporate Tax will not apply to an individual’s salary and other employment income.
However, individuals who are deriving income as a business activity would be covered under Corporate Tax.
A narrow scope of entities is exempt from Corporate Tax such as Government entities or extractive businesses (upstream oil and gas sector).

General Anti-Abuse rule, or “GAAR" applies to situations where one of the main purposes of a Transaction is to obtain a Corporate Tax Advantage not consistent with the intention or purpose of the UAE Corporate Tax Law. The FTA will address and counteract or adjust the transaction.
The GAAR only applies to transactions or arrangements entered into on or after the date the UAE Corporate Tax Law is published in the UAE Official Gazette of 10 October 2022.

A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national),[1] and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs.[2] The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.[3] Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent.

Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs.

In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, as although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner through the government provision of public goods and public services,[4][5][6][7] others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists are anti-taxation and denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying taxation as theft or extortion through coercion along with the use of force.

A business must register for VAT if their taxable supplies and imports exceed the mandatory registration threshold of AED 375,000. Furthermore, a business may choose to register for VAT voluntarily if their supplies and imports are less than the mandatory registration threshold, but exceed the voluntary registration threshold of AED 187,500. Similarly, a business may register voluntarily if their expenses exceed the voluntary registration threshold. This latter opportunity to register voluntarily is designed to enable start-up businesses with no turnover to register for VAT.[10]
The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven Emirates, with autonomous federal and local governments. An income tax decree has been enacted by each Emirate, but in practice, the enforcement of these decrees is restricted to foreign banks and oil companies.

According to the federal law, it's necessary for the FTA to conduct regular VAT audits[14] to ascertain the compliance of various businesses to the tax laws. These audits are often conducted at the workplace or at the other place of business of the involved party, as per the selection of the FTA. The notice of a similar should be issued to the person/business by the FTA a minimum of 5 days before.

Below are the elaborated procedures of VAT audit:[15]

The involved party/business/person can file their tax returns on the FTA portal as per the schedule.

The FTA authorities can check the returns and alternative details. There should not be a selected reason for the FTA to conduct an audit of a business/taxpayer. They will conduct it for any reason or whenever they are required.

A notice is going to be issued to the involved party, a minimum of 5 days before the regular audit date. It will contain details, like the audit schedule, place, concerned parties, reason (if something particular), etc.

The auditor/s and also the taxpayer can meet at the scheduled place at the scheduled time and the process can begin. The auditor might ask for business records, in original and/or copies, and take samples of products and alternative assets as obtainable at the place at the time.

Note: The audited party has the right to ask for the credentials, like professional identification cards, from the tax auditors so as to see their authority.

The tax audit is to be conducted during the official FTA operating hours, unless the Director-General decides to conduct the audit of a business outside regular hours, in an exceptional case.

The taxpayer or the other person subject to a tax audit, in conjunction with his legal representatives and tax agents, are advised to participate and help the auditors performing their task.

If something suspicious is found within the results of the audit which may impact the tax return, the authority might order a re-audit for more analysis.

The audited person has the right to ask for the notification copy and connected documents and be present throughout the auditing procedures that are conducted outside of the official places.

In March 2021, FTA said that influencers on social media in the UAE or any users using online promotional activities should register for VAT and pay taxes if the value of the services they provide is more than AED 375,000 in a 12-month period.[16]

The UAE government implemented value added tax (VAT) in the country from January 1, 2018 at a standard rate of 5%.[1][2]

In January 2022, the UAE government announced the introduction of a federal corporate tax. The standard corporate tax rate will be 9% for businesses that have a net annual profit of or over AED 375,000 and a rate of 0% for businesses with net annual profits under AED 375,000. The announcement included a corporate tax rate of 15% for multinational companies with profits over 750 million Euros a year, which is in line with the Global minimum corporate tax rate agreement. Freezone businesses can get exempt from corporate tax as long as they do not do business with the UAE mainland and follow other UAE guidelines.[3] The country aims to commence the implementation of the corporate tax regimen starting 01 June 2023.[4] Mainland companies also have to pay a percentage of their revenue to a local company, depending on the areas they are in. [5][6] There are also sin taxes on alcohol, energy drinks, vapes, and cigarettes in the UAE.[7][8]




All Free Zone entities, including Qualifying Free Zone Persons, required are to register and file a Corporate Tax return. Qualifying Free Zone Persons that meet the relevant conditions will be able to benefit from the 0% Free Zone Corporate Tax regime automatically. However, they can elect not to apply the Free Zone Corporate Tax regime and instead be subject to the regular Corporate Tax regime and rates. It is important to note that even if a free zone business qualifies for an exemption, they will still need to keep proper accounting records and file an annual tax submission with FTA.

Page 2The roots of taxa�on lie in the act of record keeping. Taxes have been an integral part of many economies for years now, 
however the tax landscape of the Gulf region had not gained momentum �ll 2015.
OECD and G20 published ﬁnal reports outlining recommenda�ons for Ac�on Plan on Base Erosion and Proﬁt 
Shi�ing (‘BEPS’) in 2015. Being the signatory to Inclusive Framework members and Mul�lateral Conven�on, 
UAE brought into force various regula�ons requiring disclosures of the organisa�onal structure and nature of 
ac�vi�es.
UAE introduced VAT on 1st January 2018 at a standard rate of 5% backed by a vision to reduce the economy’s 
dependence on income sourced from hydrocarbons. In 2019, the country further introduced Country by Coun-
try Repor�ng (CbCR) and Economic Substance Regula�on (ESR) and in 2020, it became mandatory to furnish 
details of the Ul�mate Beneﬁcial Owner (UBO). Each of these regula�ons are concrete steps taken by the UAE 
to comply with its commitment to BEPS.
In line with its commitment to the Global Minimum Taxa�on Regime, UAE recently introduced Corporate Tax 
and CT will apply equally to all categories of proﬁt and net income  reported in the ﬁnancial statements prepa-
red in accordance with interna�onally acceptable accoun�ng standards. Corporate Tax coming into force in 
the UAE landscape catapults the country into being a part of a global ﬁnancial ecosystem instead of limi�ng its  
poten�al as a tax haven.
Introduc�on of Corporate Tax (CT) in the UAE meets interna�onal standards for tax transparency and prevents 
harmful tax prac�ces; further cemen�ng the UAE’s posi�on as a global des�na�on for business.  Here are 
some Frequently Asked Ques�ons pertaining to areas within the UAE business landscape likely to be impacted
